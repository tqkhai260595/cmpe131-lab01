In this lab, I learned that using branches lets me try changes without worrying about breaking the main code. I could work on my own branch, test things out, and only merge when I felt ready. I think this makes teamwork easier because it stops problems like people writing over each other’s work or pushing code that isn’t done. Branches just keep the project more organized and make group work less stressful.
